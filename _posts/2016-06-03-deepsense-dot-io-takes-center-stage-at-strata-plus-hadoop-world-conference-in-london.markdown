deepsense.io is the conference’s Strategic Sponsor (along with Intel and Google Cloud Platform) and its senior executives will deliver both a keynote speech and a session covering the company’s recent win in Kaggle’s Right Whale Recognition Challenge. Another conference highlight will be deepsense.io’s live demo of Seahorse, its Apache Spark-powered scalable data analytics workbench, at the Intel Theatre at the Exhibit Hall.

“Strata + Hadoop World is a crucial IT industry conference, and deepsense.io has been taking part in it for quite some time. That’s why we are particularly pleased to join other Big Data industry leaders such as Cloudera, IBM, Teradata, Intel and Google as high-level sponsors of this year’s event,” said deepsense.io CEO Tomasz Kulakowski. 

“Global interest in our win in Kaggle’s Right Whale Recognition Challenge shows the tremendous demand for deep learning solutions in numerous science and business contexts. We want to show Strata + Hadoop World attendees the ways in which an innovative approach to data analysis can significantly boost company growth and perhaps even change the world. Unfortunately, many companies still don’t realize that their data-analysis challenges can be solved by using machine learning solutions. This ‘awareness chasm’ will be the subject of CTO Piotr Niedzwiedz’s keynote speech on June 2, 2016.”

deepsense.io’s machine learning team recently received global media coverage following its win in Kaggle.com’s Right Whale Recognition Challenge. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries asked participants to develop an automated facial recognition process for identifying individual North Atlantic right whales based on aerial photographs. The deepsense.io team’s solution captured first place, topping entries from 364 other participants. Team captain and deepsense.io CSO Robert Bogucki will present “Which whale is it anyway? Facial recognition for right whales using deep learning” at 11:15 a.m. on Thursday, June 2 in Capital Suite 7.

deepsense.io CTO Piotr Niedzwiedz will deliver a keynote speech on applying machine learning and deep learning solutions in various business contexts at 9:50 a.m. on Thursday, June 2 at the Auditorium.

Also on June 2, deepsense.io will present a live demo of Seahorse 1.1 at 1 p.m. at the Intel Theatre in the Exhibit Hall. Seahorse allows data scientists to visually design, edit and execute Spark applications using a Web-based code-free interface.
